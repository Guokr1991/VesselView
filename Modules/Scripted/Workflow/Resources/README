Add Json configuration files in the folders here.

Creating a new folder will create a new kind of task.
The task name is based on the folder's name.

Each task can customize the properties of the CLIs used int the workflow that
are not exposed to the user. This is done by adding json configuration files
with the names of the corresponding CLIs in the task's folder.

The Workflow.json is used to customize the workflow naming. It is intended
to help the developer create hinteful names in relation with each task.
